# Adventures of a Dragon
A classic text-based rpg, with a twist.



How many rpgs have you played where you're the dragon-slaying, town-saving hero? 
How many have you played where instead, you're the dragon?

Welcome to Adventures of a Dragon, a generic title for a generic game, but instead, you're the dragon.
## Current Information
Local multiplayer will need a lot of work. The T1, T2, and T3 in filenames are tiers. Barebones are completed enough to compund progress.
